Your job is to write a short journal entry about what just happened in this session.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the file `process.md` in the working directory to understand what has already been logged.\n2. Read the file `CLAUDE.md` in the working directory to understand the project context.\n3. Based on the conversation so far in your context, identify the most recent meaningful work — what was accomplished, decided, or built?\n4. Write a 2–4 sentence journal entry in first-person, past tense, as if the developer themselves is writing it. It should sound natural and human — not like a log or a bullet list. Focus on meaningful progress or decisions, not individual file edits.\n5. If the last turn was trivial (a greeting, a clarification, nothing meaningful happened), skip writing entirely.\n6. Get the current time using the `date` command.\n7. Append the entry to `process.md` using bash: first check if today's heading exists, add it if not, then append the entry. Use the bash tool to write directly to the file — do NOT use the Edit or Write tools.\n\nFormat: `**HH:MM** — <entry text>` under `## YYYY-MM-DD` heading.\n\nTone examples:\n- \"Set up the Vite project with TypeScript and Tailwind. Got the basic shell running and confirmed hot reload was working before moving on.\"\n- \"Spent some time thinking through the mobile navigation approach. Went with a bottom tab bar on mobile rather than a hamburger menu — it felt more natural for a dashboard.\"\n- \"Finished the mock data generators. The shipments data now spans 2020 to 2026 with realistic seasonal variation, which should make the charts look more believable.\"",
